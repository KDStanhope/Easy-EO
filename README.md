# Easy-EO
Makes Novatel Station Files from a Phase One Exif CSV

Input is the ExifLog.csv from the Phase Ones. Using the filenames, a station file is created which may be later imported into InertialExplorer or Gravnav. 
The filename is renamed to the desired image format extension so that the EO exported form InertialExplorer needs not be edited to match the processed imagery from IXCapture.
